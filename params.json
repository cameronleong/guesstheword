The bounds always start from the first and last words in the bot's dictionary: **aardvark** and **zygote**.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the word chosen is **credible** then typing in **cat** will prompt the bot to respond with  \r\n\r\n`Guess the word between **cat** and **zygote**`  \r\n\r\nsince credible is between cat and zygote (but not aardvark and cat). Following that logic, typing in **dog** will prompt the response\r\n\r\n`Guess the word between **cat** and **dog**`. \r\n\r\nTake note that alphabetical order means that words like \"catastrophe\" and \"dane\" are valid words that are between **cat** and **dog** while words like \"cab\" aren't (both cata... and d... are after cat but cab is before c-a-t).\r\n\r\n**Commands**  \r\n`!word` - Starts a game of Guess the Word  \r\n`!help` - Displays this page  \r\n`!abc`  - Lists the english alphabet for your convenience  \r\n`!hint` - Reveals first three letters once there are less than 200 words left  \r\n`!stop` - Stops an ongoing game  \r\n`!score` - Displays the top five players  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
